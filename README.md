# Evolutionary Relationships through Protein-Protein Interactions


This project was my Senior Capstone project. I worked in Python with NetworkX and Jupyter.
The main file is the .ipynb file, if you don't have jupyter installed to view the file you can still get a lot of information from the write-up.
This program was built to study evolutionary relationships among a handful of vertebrate species by performing missing link prediction on their proteins. 
I created a bipartite network first, between proteins and the species which have that protein, then I created both possible projections of the bipartite network, and did missing link prediction on the protein-protein projection network. 
I was able to make predictions about evolutionary relationships and further research those predictions to gain a level of qualitative accuracy on them. 

Please read the write-up (the pdf)! It's incredibly detailed (though it couldn't possibly encompass everything I learned in this project) and goes over everything I did to achieve this.
